# TikTok PACE Strategy

**Course One: Foundations of Data Science**

This PACE strategy document records decisions and reflections made during the project. It serves as both a guide for this project and a reusable framework for future analytics work.

---

## Course Project Recap
Goals for this project:
- Complete the PACE Strategy Document to plan the project (audience, milestones, goals).
- Create a project proposal for the data team.

---

## Relevant Interview Questions
Completing this project enables discussion of:
- As a new team member, how would you get up to speed with a current project? Who would you meet with?  
- How do you plan an analytics project?  
- How do you translate a business question into an analytical solution?  
- Why is actively managing data an important responsibility of a data analytics team?

  - What is the condition of the dataset?  
  - Which variables are most useful?  
  - Are there trends that provide insight?  
  - How can bias be reduced?  
- **Resources required**: Dataset, Python notebooks, stakeholder input.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - Cleaned dataset for EDA  
  - Visualizations  
  - Statistical model(s)  
  - Regression and/or machine learning model
