# TikTok Claims Classification ‚Äî Google Advanced Data Analytics Project

This repository showcases my end-to-end work from the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**, where I analyzed TikTok videos to classify content as **claims vs opinions** and explored engagement trends.  

The project follows the **PACE framework (Plan, Analyze, Communicate, Execute)** and includes executive summaries, project proposal, notebooks, and strategy documents.

## üìë Executive Summaries
Each milestone of the project includes a formal executive summary with key findings:

- [Data Analysis Executive Summary](docs/Data_Analysis_Executive_Summary.pdf)  
- [EDA Executive Summary](docs/EDA_Executive_Summary.pdf)  
- [Regression Executive Summary](docs/Regression_Executive_Summary.pdf)  
- [Machine Learning Executive Summary](docs/ML_Executive_Summary.pdf)  
- [Statistics Executive Summary](docs/Statistics_Executive_Summary.pdf)

## üìì Notebooks
The full workflow is documented in Jupyter notebooks:

- [01_data_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/01_Data_Analysis.ipynb) ‚Äî Initial data analysis and cleaning
- [02_statistical_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/TikTok%20Project%20Statistical%20Analysis.ipynb) ‚Äî Hypothesis testing and statistical analysis  
- [03_visualizations.ipynb](notebooks/TikTok%20Project%20Visualizations.ipynb) ‚Äî Exploratory visualizations and engagement trends  
- [04_regression.ipynb](notebooks/TikTok%20project%20Regression.ipynb) ‚Äî Regression modeling  
- [05_machine_learning.ipynb](notebooks/TikTok%20Project%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) ‚Äî Machine learning classification models

## üîç Methods & Tools
- **EDA**: Distribution checks, missingness, engagement analysis  
- **Regression**: Linear/logistic models for predicting outcomes  
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, feature importance  
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics  
- **Visualizations**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## üéØ Outcomes
- Confirmed a **balanced dataset** of claims vs opinions (~50/50 split).  
- Found **claims videos had much higher engagement** (mean ‚âà 500k views vs ~5k for opinions).  
- Built baseline regression and classification models, improving performance with tree-based models.  
- Delivered executive summaries and stakeholder-ready documentation at each milestone.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Expand feature engineering (text features, temporal trends).  
- Experiment with deep learning (e.g., LSTMs, transformers for text).  
- Build an automated pipeline with CI/CD to train/evaluate models.
