# TikTok Claims Classification — Google Advanced Data Analytics Project

This repository showcases my end-to-end work from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, where I analyzed TikTok videos to classify content as **claims vs opinions** and explored engagement trends.

## 📂 Repository structure
- `docs/` — executive summaries, project proposal, and PACE strategy  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, visualizations, regression, ML, and statistical analysis  
- `reports/` — (optional) results and figures  
- `data/` — raw and processed data (not included here for privacy)

## 📑 Key Documents
- [PACE Strategy (PDF)](docs/Tik%20Tok%20PACE%20Strategy.pdf)  
- [Project Proposal (DOCX)](docs/_Tik%20Tok%20Project%20Proposal.docx)  
- [Executive Summary — Course 2 (PDF)](docs/Tik%20Tok%20Executive%20Summary%20Course%202.pdf)

## 📓 Notebooks
- [01_data_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/01_data_analysis.ipynb)  
- [02_visualizations.ipynb](notebooks/02_visualizations.ipynb)  
- [03_regression.ipynb](notebooks/03_regression.ipynb)  
- [04_machine_learning.ipynb](notebooks/04_machine_learning.ipynb)  
- [05_statistical_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/05_statistical_analysis.ipynb)

## 🔍 Methods
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to check class balance and engagement
- Regression and statistical tests
- Machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, etc.)
- Visualizations and executive summaries at each milestone

## 🎯 Outcomes
- Found a balanced dataset of claims vs opinions
- Identified engagement differences (claims had higher mean/median views)
- Built baseline and tree-based classifiers to predict claim vs opinion
